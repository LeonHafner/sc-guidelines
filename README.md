# Benchmarking Pipeline (Nextflow Version) - Work In Progress

This branch is currently under active development and aims to provide a nextflow version of the used benchmarking pipeline.

## Work In Progress

Please note that this version of the pipeline is not final and contains elements that are subject to change, including hardcoded links and manually specified dependencies. It is intended for development and testing purposes only.
Due to the current hardcoding of Conda environment links, there is no docker/apptainer support.
The pipeline in its current state is intended only for development purposes and is therefore designed to run only on a specific cluster.
